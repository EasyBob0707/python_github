How have you been? It had been quite some time since we last met.
Nice to meet you C. I am A. I'm a psychology student.
Today is the last day of my final exam.
Yes. Do both of you have any plans for your holidays?
It is very convenient then. I heard the accomodation there is very expansive. Since your sister is there then you don't need to worry much.
Have you found one?
Just like B, I am planning to go for a trip but I have not decide on which country to visit.
I was thinking about Thailand or Korea.
Yes I think so too. That is the reason why I have not make up my decision yet.
Bye. Take care.
